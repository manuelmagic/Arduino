## My Arduino sketches

This repository contains a few simple projects from the [Arduino starter kit](https://store.arduino.cc/genuino-starter-kit) book.

List of sketches:
* **astro**: a simple circuit with LEDs and a push button, connected to Arduino using digital pins
* **temperature** a nice circuit with LEDs (controlled with digital pins) and the TMP36 temperature sensor, connected to Arduino via an analog pin
